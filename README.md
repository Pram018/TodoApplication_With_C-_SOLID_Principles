# Simple To-Do Console Application (C++)

A terminal-based To-Do list manager built with raw C++ and a minimal Makefile — designed as a hands-on exercise in applying the **SOLID principles** of object-oriented design.

---

## Purpose

This project was built to practice and demonstrate the **SOLID principles** in C++:

- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class has one clear purpose (e.g., task handling, file I/O).
- **O**pen/Closed: Code is designed to be extendable without modifying core logic.
- **L**iskov Substitution: Derived types can replace base types seamlessly.
- **I**nterface Segregation: Interfaces are minimal and focused.
- **D**ependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

---

## Features

- Add, view, complete, and delete tasks
- Persistent storage using plain text
- Modular class design aligned with SOLID
- Clean separation of concerns
- Simple CLI interface
